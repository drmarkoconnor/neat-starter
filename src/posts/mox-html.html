<h1>Written in html marky markdown</h1>

a link to the <a href="http://bbc.com/">BBC</a> as html works I can style blogs
directly and use the content from my 50:50 course with Brad I really need to
mind map this out and then create a commented template Next is to use the CMS
get some basic flow around git so you avoid the resetting of the remote origin
etc
