Here the first line is not indeneted. But when another person speaks the following paragraph must be indented.

\    "Do you mean like this, Sir?' said Sir Lancelot, as he tied his horse to the lance stand being careful to not capitalise the word said as the quote is part of a continuing sentence.

\    "Yes, that is exactly what I was meaning."

   At this point I was wondering how the hard coded four spaces acting as a tab would render in the browser.
