Flax Bourton Village Hub and Flax Bourton Parish Council have joined forces to ask our local community and residents about their views on the village and the Hub building. This is generously supported by the UK Community Renewal Fund and supported locally by West of England Rural Network and North Somerset Council. This is a great opportunity to find out what people think about life in the village, what would improve it, and how we could use the Flax Bourton Village Hub better.

We took the opportunity of the Flax Bourton Community Festival over the Jubilee weekend to start asking people what they thought about life in the village. Many of you will have seen the stall and many of you will have contributed your comments. We invited you to contribute your comments under four main headings: natural environment, traffic & transport, community facilities, and social/resident needs. We were delighted to find the comments board so full of coloured Post-It notes by the end of the afternoon.





Overall, we had 162 suggestions from at least 79 households

 

We have now had a chance to review the ideas received we can report that the top priorities so far suggest:

▪ Traffic is an important issue – particularly speeds along the A370 and Clevedon Road, and the need for more safe crossing points

▪ Children want more to do in the village – we had lots of votes for a skate park and other sports and leisure facilities

▪ People want a local shop and café

▪ Children and adults want more things to do locally – with ideas such as more clubs and groups, places to site and meet, and events such as a Hog Roast that was a feature of the Community Festival

The next stage of this project will be a household survey asking more detailed questions about your views and suggestions. So, look out for the paper questionnaires dropping through your letterboxes. There will also be opportunities to fill it in online that will be shared through the usual channels.

We look forward to reporting back in more detail over the summer
