	<p>
		This index.html page use the default layout its page frontmatter (which
		really should be a home layout perhaps) which in turn injects the navbar and
		the footer via an include _partials/navbar and header. The navbar needs a
		hamburger button sorting
	</p>
	<p>
		The default page uses some conditional logic in its head to add css link to
		bootstrap and for metadata depending on a pages frontmatter description: and
		boot: values
	</p>
	<p>
		The navbar derives its links from the navigation.yaml as another example of
		using 11ty's very useful' data cascade
	</p>
	<p>
		the boot switch basically allows any page where boot is true to use boostrap
		5 classes. The main style sheet is listedlast in the default head so will
		have a greater prioroty howeveer. Useful for one off bits of styling perhaps
	</p>
	<p>an include below introduces linkls from the yaml 'data' file quicklinks</p>
	<p>The links below are in the quicklinks.yaml file in the _data directory</p>
