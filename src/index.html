<div class="hero">
	<h1 class="">Welcome to {{title}} <i class="fas fa-home fa-4x"></i></h1>
	<h2>Default layouts</h2>
	<p>
		This home page (index.html) references the default.html layout (in _layouts
		dir) in its page frontmatter which in turn injects the navbar and the footer
		via an include _partials/navbar and header.
	</p>
	<h2>Front matter conditonal logic</h2>
	<p>
		The template default page uses some conditional logic in its head to add a
		css link to bootstrap, font-awesome and for metadata depending on a
		particular page's frontmatter as follows.
		<blockquote>
		<li>
			description: "any text here gets into the page's meta data</li>" ( and can be used for
			other purposes too )
		</li>
		<li>boot: true</li>
		will mean the page can reference bootstrap classes
		<li>awesome: true</li>
		will allow use of the "fa fas-name" icons from
		<a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font awesome</a></blockquote>
	</p>
	<h2>Data derived nav links</h2>
	<p>
		The navbar derives its links from iterating over the elements of the navigation.yaml file. The Netlify CMS can change this file too ( whetheer that is useful is a use case for each user of this template)
	</p>
	<h2>CSS Styling</h2><p>
	The main style sheet is listed last in the default head so will
		have a greater priority thasn the others referenced.
	</p>
	<h2>Data derived content</h2>
	<p>This css styled 'table' (it's not a table ) is generated from data, held in the quicklinks.yaml file, iterated over by the partial contents.html file. Styling is in styles.css using a .quicklinks class</p>
<!--  -->
	{% include "./_includes/partials/content.html" %}
	<h2>Colour scheme</h2>
	Define <code>var(--primary-color-XXX):hsl(x,y%,z%) </code> and
	<code> var(--secondary-color-XXX):hsl(x,y%,z%)</code> using XXX to indicate different shades of same color. Makes colour ( I'm English, this is how we spell it!) palette very easy to change for whole site.
