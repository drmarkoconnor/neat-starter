<h1>Hubber's team</h1>
<p>
	This page uses a team.json database (in the _data/ directory) of team members
	with 4 properties. 
	The front matter contains a height: 10vh key value pair
	which is used to set the style property of the cards ( which would be set to
	40vh in the stylesheet.) <p> The page style has a higher specificty so this is a
	goood trick</p>
